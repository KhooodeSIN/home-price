1️⃣ Build a general regression model
Use the column Price as the target variable (y).

Use the other columns as features (X).

Train a linear regression model to predict house prices.

Calculate the error (difference between actual and predicted prices).

Select houses with small errors as recommended houses, since they are fairly priced.

2️⃣ Analyze each feature individually
Loop through each feature column.

Train a regression model using only that single feature.

Compute the R² score to measure how well each feature predicts price on its own.

Sort features by R² score.

Plot a bar chart to visualize which features are most important for price prediction.

3️⃣ Analyze by region
If there is a Region column, group the recommended houses by region.

Find the region with the highest number of recommended houses (meaning more fairly priced options).

Plot a bar chart to show the number of recommended houses per region.

Finally, suggest the best region to buy, based on the most recommended houses.

4️⃣ Confusion matrix (if there is a categorical column)
If there is a categorical column (e.g., Region, Quality), build a classification model.

Create and display a confusion matrix to see how well the model predicts each category.

Useful for analyzing model performance on discrete classes.

✅ 🏁 Final outputs
✔ Recommended houses: Houses with prices close to the predicted value (fair price).
✔ Important features: Features with the highest individual predictive power (based on R² score).
✔ Best region: The region with the most recommended houses, suggesting it is the best area to buy.
✔ Confusion matrix: Shows classification accuracy (if applicable).
